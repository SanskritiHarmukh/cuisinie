Machine Learning infused Culinary Companion.

Starting a culinary journey frequently starts with a straightforward inquiry: "What dish can I create using this ingredient?" However, transitioning from an ingredient to a creative dish is frequently hindered by disorganized resources and scattered information. Addressing this prevalent culinary challenge, this work introduces an innovative solution - a centralized platform crafted to transform how users explore and interact with recipes. After exhaustive study of different competitor platforms, the user needs has been identified and analysed.  This platform will enable users to easily input ingredients via text or images and gain access to a curetted assortment of recipe videos, articles, and blogs, simplifying the process from inspiration to creation. 

The "Cuisinie: Machine Learning Infused Culinary Companion" project is centered around developing an innovative Flutter-based mobile application that transforms the culinary experience. This application will allow users to discover recipes through advanced search methods, including manual text input, intuitive filters (such as ingredients and cuisine type), and cutting-edge image recognition for ingredient-based searches. The platform will integrate diverse multimedia content like video tutorials, recipe blogs, and cooking techniques to enrich culinary knowledge. The aim of the Cuisinie project is to revolutionize cooking, making it accessible, enjoyable, and inspiring for users of all culinary backgrounds and expertise levels.
